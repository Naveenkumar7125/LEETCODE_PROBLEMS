## Problem 3402: Minimum Operations to Ensure Strictly Increasing Columns

### Problem Description:
Given a 2D grid `grid` of integers, your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations required to make the grid strictly increasing column-wise. In each operation, you can select any element `grid[i][j]` and increment it by a positive integer.

The grid is considered strictly increasing column-wise if for each column `j`, and for each row `i`:
- `grid[i][j] < grid[i+1][j]` for all `i` where `0 <= i < grid.length - 1`

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumOperations(int[][] grid) {
        int res = 0;
        int s = 0;

        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0 || grid[0].length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        for(int i=0;i<grid[0].length;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<grid.length-1;j++)
            {
                if(grid[j][i]>=grid[j+1][i])
                {
                    s = grid[j][i] - grid[j+1][i] + 1;
                    res += s;
                    grid[j+1][i]+=s;
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
}
