# Problem: 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Link**: [LeetCode - 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/)

## Problem Statement
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

- I pick a number between 1 and `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.
- Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`:
- `-1`: My number is lower.
- `1`: My number is higher.
- `0`: Congrats! You guessed my number.

**Your goal**: Implement a function to find the number I picked.

### Constraints
- \( 1 \leq n \leq 2^{31} - 1 \)
- \( 1 \leq \text{picked number} \leq n \)

## Solution (Java)
```java
/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param  num   your guess
 * @return 	     -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 *			      1 if num is lower than the picked number
 *               otherwise return 0
 * int guess(int num);

public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        int l = 0, r = n;
        while (l <= r) {
            int mid = l + (r-l)/2;
            
            int result = guess(mid); 
            
            if(result == 0) 
            {
                return mid; 
            }
            else if(result == -1) 
            {
                r = mid - 1; 
            }
            else 
            {
                l = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
